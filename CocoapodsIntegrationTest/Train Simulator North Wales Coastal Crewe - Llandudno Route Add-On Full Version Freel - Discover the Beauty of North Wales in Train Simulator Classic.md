The North Wales Coast Line has a rich and fascinating history, dating back to the 19th century. It was originally built as a key route for passengers, freight and the Irish Mail service heading from the major English towns to Ireland via Holyhead and vice versa[^5^]. The line was completed in 1848 by the Chester and Holyhead Railway, which later became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR)[^1^]. The line was electrified in 1986 by British Rail, using the 25 kV AC overhead system[^1^].
 
The line offers spectacular views of the Welsh coastline, as well as many historic and cultural attractions along the way. You can visit the famous Conwy Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was built by Edward I in the 13th century[^1^]. You can also explore the seaside towns of Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Rhyl, which were popular tourist destinations in the Victorian era[^1^]. You can also admire the engineering marvels of the Britannia Bridge and the Conwy Railway Bridge, which span the Menai Strait and the River Conwy respectively[^1^].
